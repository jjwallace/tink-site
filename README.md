# T.I.N.K — Landing Site

Marketing/landing page for **T.I.N.K** (Thought Interactive Neural Kernel).

```bash
cd repos/nest/site
bun install
bun run dev    # http://localhost:5181
```

## What it is

A single-page scroll-driven dark site. A Pixi canvas hosts three actors —
sphere, anchor, creature (Tink) — choreographed against scroll progress.
Real SFX (lifted from native) play at set-pieces; a Web Audio chirp synth
provides the "voice" without shipping any audio files for it.

## Shared assets

Assets used by more than one nest sibling live in
`repos/nest/shared/assets/`. The Vite alias `@shared/*` resolves there.
See `repos/nest/shared/README.md`.

Improvements to the sphere SVG or SFX in `shared/` automatically appear here.

## Scroll choreography

The Stage maps page scroll progress (0..1) to actor positions across
five acts. Adjust in `src/stage/Stage.tsx → choreograph()`.

| Range | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0.00..0.05 | Anchor streaks in from top-right, hits bottom-center |
| 0.05..0.30 | Anchor hovers, gentle pulse |
| 0.30..0.55 | Anchor rises; A copy fades |
| 0.55..0.85 | Tink emerges, orbits the anchor; B copy fades in |
| 0.85..1.00 | Settles into the footer |

## Audio

Two layers:

1. **Real SFX** (Howler, `@shared/sfx/*.mp3|.wav`) for one-shot moments:
   arrival, hover chirp, ambient hum.
2. **Web Audio synthesis** for the "Tink voice" — no audio files. Each
   chirp is a short FM-modulated oscillator with a sharp envelope.
   Tweak in `src/audio/voice.ts`.

Audio context unlocks on first pointer/key/touch (iOS/Safari requirement).

## Known follow-ups

- Anchor visual is a simplified stand-in. Port full native anchor
  (`repos/nest/native/src/features/voice-anchor/`) for higher fidelity.
- Sphere is a placeholder SVG. Iterate in `shared/sphere/sphere.svg`.
- Add a real GitHub/download link in `src/lore.ts → FOOTER_LINKS`.
- Mobile: scroll choreography assumes desktop viewport; needs a tighter
  layout breakpoint pass.

## Deploy

Static build (`bun run build`) → `dist/`. Drop into Vercel/Cloudflare Pages.
